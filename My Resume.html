    <h2>My Profile</h2>
 <p>
    I hold a degree in Business Management from Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University within the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences in Burdur, Turkey. Before relocating to Manchester, I was working in the position of Passenger Service Agent at Sabiha Gokcen International Airport (SAW) in Istanbul, in which I had become a solid and efficient team member. I have experience in various roles such as Ground Handling Officer, and duties such as delivering a professional check-in service, monitoring and handling baggage, and announcing flight details to keep passengers informed and ensure a smooth-running operation. I am always eager to learn and take on additional roles and responsibilities. I have demonstrated many of my qualities in my previous work experiences, including being adaptable, consistent, and able to build strong professional relationships to ensure the maximum quality of customer service.</p>
